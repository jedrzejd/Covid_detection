## General info

The project aims to support the Covid-19 detection process by automatic analysis of the x-ray image of the lungs.

I trained the model on publicly available datasets

## Technologies

* Python 3.72

## Status

* Now
    * The application for a given X-ray image classifies the image into 4 categories (healthy / bacterial pneumonia / viral pneumonia / Covid-19).
    
* In Future
    - Adding a new model (transfer learning).
    - Collection of large amounts of high-quality data
